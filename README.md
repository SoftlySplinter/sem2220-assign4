Write an essay to discuss the above statement. As part of your essay, make
sure you discuss the following:

* Technically, the ways individuals can be monitored, and whether there are variations across mobile platforms.
* The features on mobile platforms and within the mobile ecosystem that can be used to protect against unwanted monitoring.

Include a bibliography that lists the resources (e.g. books, research papers, online articles) that you have reviewed to research this topic. Your essay should cite the resources in your bibliography.

# Submission

Upload a 2000 word PDF document to Blackboard by **5pm Wednesday 22nd January 2014**. The word limit does not include the bibliography or small footnotes. Please use 12pt Calibri or Arial font.

If you do not have access to Blackboard at the time that you submit your document, you should email a copy of it to Chris Loftus (cwl@aber.ac.uk) by the same submission deadline.

For the citations and references follow the IEEE Citation Reference [[1](#bib1)]. In particular use the guidelines for Books and Online Sources.

If you are late then please complete a Late Assignment Submission [[2](#bib2)] form and hand this in to the Department office.

**Note:** this is an "individual" assignment and must be completed as a one person effort by the student submitting the work.

This assignment **is** marked anonymously. Please do not include your name or email in the essay, but rather include your Student Reference Number.

When you submit your report to Blackboard, you will be shown the wording regarding the **Declaration of Originality**; these are the same as those found on the Anonymous Marking Sheet, which is available on the resources page of the Department's Intranet [2]. When you click submit, we will assume that you have agreed to the terms of that statement. You do not need to complete a separate form regarding the Declaration of Originality.

We will attempt to provide provisional marks and feedback by Wednesday 5th February 2014.
