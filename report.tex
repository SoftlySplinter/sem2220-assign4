\section{Introduction}

There has been a lot of news in the press in the last year about surveillance
programs run by many countries security agencies, particularly focused on the
collection of phone records by the \gls{NSA}\cite{greenwald2013nsa}.

It comes as no surprise that this has brought about the question: 

\begin{quote}
``Have mobile devices made us the most monitored individuals in history?''
\end{quote}

To fully understand the depth of this question, one must consider the technical
methods which are employed to monitor mobile devices and how these methods
differ across different mobile platforms. In hand with this, one must
investigate the methods for preventing unwanted monitoring on mobile devices
and how effective these methods really are.

Finally there are many legal and professional issues which govern the
collection of data from mobile devices; but there are also a host of ethical
and social issues which legal and professional element cannot, necessarily,
cover.

Of course monitoring of data, especially from mobile devices, doesn't have to
be used for nefarious purposes. Applications commonly use data mining techniques
to provide a better experience for their users and cloud services are so popular
that imagining a world where all a users data is stored solely on a single
device is almost impossible.

\section{Technical Methods for Monitoring Mobile Devices}

Because of the structure of the \gls{GSM}, any mobile device which accesses
the mobile network can be tracked to, at worst, the nearest cell tower. In 
fact the \gls{NSA} is known to use this data to track targets and identify 
possible accomplices\cite{classified2012co-travel}. There are also other
stories of UK public organisations performing similar
actions\cite{gallager2011met}\cite{hopkins2013gchq}.

Though this is a worrying concept, there is some important information that the
U.S. has given in \cite{clapper2013facts} which denies that any information
collected cannot be used to target any individual without a prior specific and
documented reason to do so. In the case of monitoring of non-U.S. citizens
there must also be a agreement with the country of their citizenship.

It is the monitoring which the users agrees to have performed upon them that is
perhaps more worrying.

Mobile devices, especially tablets and smart phones, have a range of sensors
which third-party applications may be able to access. These sensors typically
include a camera, microphone, WiFi antenna and GPS system. As technology
progresses the accuracy of these sensors is increasing and other sensors such
as accelerometers are becoming more prevalent.

It could, therefore, be easy for an attacker to write a malicious application
which simply monitored the GPS location of a person or recorded their
conversations through the microphone. Or even use any of these systems combined
to gather a lot of sensitive data.

There have been cases which have been formally
investigated\cite{ftc2013flashlight} in which legitimate applications collect
data from users on the side, which are then sold to other companies for
advertisement revenue.

However, a lot of applications have legitimate uses for these sensors. Most
applications require network access to load data from external servers. More
specific applications, which perform tasks like route tracking, will require
the use of more than one of these sensors.

So how do mobile platforms allow developers to access these systems when they
have legitimate reasons?

Modern mobile platforms typically have some sort of security system and ways in
which applications can be given access to secure elements of the mobile device.
Most of these platforms sandbox third-party application allowing the kernel to
control the access to the various facilities of the device.

\subsection{Android Security Facilities}

\cite{google2013security} describes the methods the Android system uses to
secure the environment. The main advantage Android gains in this area is that
uses \gls{SELinux}, which confines the access of programs based on different
policies.

Android adds many features on top of this, the most applicable of these to the
question of monitoring is the permission model. For a third party application
to access protected APIs such at GPS positioning or network connections they
must implicitly define which of these elements they require in the manifest
file of the application.

This information is displayed to the user when they first install the
application and when the application updates to add new access to secure APIs.

There are also certain APIs which are not available to third-party 
applications, but which may be used by pre-installed applications if they are
signed as part of the OS.

Because applications are sandboxed from one another it should be an impossible
task to gain confidential information from another application, unless it
provides it somehow.
