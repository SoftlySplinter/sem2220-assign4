\section{Introduction}

There has been a lot of news in the press in the last year about surveillance
programs run by many countries security agencies, particularly focused on the
collection of phone records by the NSA\cite{greenwald2013nsa}.

It comes as no surprise that this has brought about the question: 

\begin{quote}
``Have mobile devices made us the most monitored individuals in history?''
\end{quote}

To fully understand the depth of this question, one must consider the technical
methods which are employed to monitor mobile devices and how these methods
differ across different mobile platforms. In hand with this, one must
investigate the methods for preventing unwanted monitoring on mobile devices
and how effective these methods really are.

Finally there are many legal and professional issues which govern the
collection of data from mobile devices; but there are also a host of ethical
and social issues which legal and professional element cannot, necessarily,
cover.

Of course monitoring of data, especially from mobile devices, doesn't have to
be used for nefarious purposes. Applications commonly use data mining techniques
to provide a better experience for their users and cloud services are so popular
that imagining a world where all a users data is stored solely on a single
device is almost impossible.
