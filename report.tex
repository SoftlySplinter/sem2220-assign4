\section{Introduction}

There has been a lot of news in the press in the last year about surveillance
programs run by many countries security agencies, particularly focused on the
collection of phone records by the \gls{NSA}\cite{greenwald2013nsa}.

It comes as no surprise that this has brought about the question: 

\begin{quote}
``Have mobile devices made us the most monitored individuals in history?''
\end{quote}

To fully understand the depth of this question, one must consider the technical
methods which are employed to monitor mobile devices and how these methods
differ across different mobile platforms. In hand with this, one must
investigate the methods for preventing unwanted monitoring on mobile devices
and how effective these methods really are.

Finally there are many legal and professional issues which govern the
collection of data from mobile devices; but there are also a host of ethical
and social issues which legal and professional element cannot, necessarily,
cover.

Of course monitoring of data, especially from mobile devices, doesn't have to
be used for nefarious purposes. Applications commonly use data mining techniques
to provide a better experience for their users and cloud services are so popular
that imagining a world where all a users data is stored solely on a single
device is almost impossible.

\section{Technical Methods for Monitoring Mobile Devices}

Because of the structure of the \gls{GSM}, any mobile device which accesses
the mobile network can be tracked to, at worst, the nearest cell tower. In 
fact the \gls{NSA} is known to use this data to track targets and identify 
possible accomplices\cite{classified2012co-travel}. There are also other
stories of UK public organisations performing similar
actions\cite{gallager2011met}\cite{hopkins2013gchq}.

Though this is a worrying concept, there is some important information that the
U.S. has given in \cite{clapper2013facts} which denies that any information
collected cannot be used to target any individual without a prior specific and
documented reason to do so. In the case of monitoring of non-U.S. citizens
there must also be a agreement with the country of their citizenship.

It is the monitoring which the users agrees to have performed upon them that is
perhaps more worrying.

Modern mobile platforms typically have some sort of security system and ways in
which applications can be given access to secure elements of the mobile device. 
Most of these platforms sandbox third-party application allowing the kernel to
control the access to the various facilities of the device.

\subsection{Android Security Facilities}

\cite{google2013security} describes the methods the Android system uses to
secure the environment. The main advantage Android gains in this area is that
runs a version of \gls{SELinux}
